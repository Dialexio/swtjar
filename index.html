<p>SWTJar is a tool for easily packaging SWT Java applications into a single cross platform Jar.

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>SWT is a Java widget toolkit that provides access to native UI elements. This presents a problem
when it comes to packaging an application as you need to include a different SWT jar for each platform
(Windows/Linux/OSX)/(32/64bit). To support all of these standard platforms you have to build and
distribute 6 different packages which isn't really in the spirit of Java's write once, run anywhere.

<p>Assuming you use ant to build your code, here is what the traditional solution looks like (showing only
32/64 bit Windows build commands).

<pre>
<!-- 32 bit windows UI -->
<jar jarfile="./build/jars/ui-win32.jar">
  <fileset dir="./build/classes" includes="**/*.class" />
  <zipfileset excludes="META-INF/*.MF" src="lib/miglayout-3.7.3.1-swt.jar"/>
  <fileset dir="./lib" includes="swt-win32-3.6.2.jar" />
</jar>
<!-- 64 bit windows UI -->
<jar jarfile="./build/jars/ui-win32.jar">
  <fileset dir="./build/classes" includes="**/*.class" />
  <zipfileset excludes="META-INF/*.MF" src="lib/miglayout-3.7.3.1-swt.jar"/>
  <fileset dir="./lib" includes="swt-win64-3.6.2.jar" />
</jar>
</pre>

<p>This is really verbose and leaves you with more files to manage and distribute - Surely there is a better way?

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>SWTJar is an ant task which allows you to build a single jar which loads the correct SWT classes
at runtime allowing you to distribute a single jar which works across (Windows/Linux/OSX)/(32/64bit).

<p>Lets take a look at what this looks like in your ant built script.

<p>First you need to declare the new ant task at the top of your build.xml file.

<pre>
<taskdef name="swtjar" classname="org.swtjar.ant.SWTJarTask"
                       classpath="./lib/swtjar.jar"/>
</pre>

<p>Here is an example of using swtjar.

<pre>
<!-- Package UI code including all libraries apart from SWT -->
<jar jarfile="./build/tmp/ui-wrapper.jar">
  <fileset dir="./build/classes" includes="**/*.class" />
  <zipfileset excludes="META-INF/*.MF" src="lib/miglayout-3.7.3.1-swt.jar"/>
</jar>

<!-- Package cross platform SWT Jar -->
<swtjar jarfile="./build/jars/ui.jar"
		targetmainclass="org.project.gui.ProjectGUI"
		targetjar="ui-wrapper.jar"
		swtversion="3.6.2">
  <fileset dir="./build/tmp" includes="ui-wrapper.jar" />
  <fileset dir="./lib" includes="swt-*-3.6.2.jar" />
</swtjar>
</pre>

<p>There are a few things to note about the swtjar task.
<ul>
<li>targetmainclass - this should be the class with the public static void main(String[] args) entry point
<li>targetjar - this must be the path to the jar built in the previous step
<li>swtversion - all the SWT jars you are using must have filenames of the format swt-&lt;platform&gt;&lt;bitness&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.jar
<ul>
<li>&lt;platform&gt; - Must be one of win/linux/osx.
<li>&lt;bitness&gt; - Must be one of 32/64.
<li>&lt;version&gt; - Any string - must match the swtversion param used in the swtjar command.
</ul>
<li>fileset - The swtjar task must only be asked to package the previously built jar (which includes all of your required libraries) and
    the SWT jars. If you include any other jars in the swtjar task then your application may not work correctly.
</ul>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>The key problem which the SWT library presents is that it requires a platform specific classpath. SWTJar implements
this by including a standard loader class which performs platform detection and then constructs an appropriate
Classloader.

<p>The reason why all your application classes and libraries need to be packaged into a wrapper jar before being 
packaged by swtjar is Classloader delegation.
